# Coding Interview Patterns

A systematic collection of common programming patterns to efficiently solve coding interview problems.

## Introduction

This repository documents my method of mastering coding patterns for technical interviews. Rather than memorizing hundreds of random problems, this approach focuses on recognizing common patterns that can be applied to solve many seemingly different questions.

## Motivation

Many coding interview problems that appear different on the surface can be solved using the same underlying patterns. By organizing my learning around these patterns rather than individual problems, I aim to:

- Develop a systematic approach to problem-solving
- Recognize pattern similarities in new problems
- Reduce the total number of problems needed to practice
- Build a reusable framework for future interview preparation

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized by patterns, with each pattern containing:

1. **Pattern Overview**: Recognition clues and when to apply this pattern
2. **Core Algorithm**: Step-by-step explanation of the pattern implementation
3. **Code Template**: Reusable skeleton code that can be adapted for similar problems
4. **Time & Space Complexity**: Analysis of algorithmic efficiency
5. **Problem Examples**: Representative problems that use this pattern with my solutions
6. **Variations**: Common modifications of the base pattern

## Patterns Included

- Two Pointers
- Sliding Window
- Fast & Slow Pointers (Floyd's Cycle Detection)
- Merge Intervals
- Cyclic Sort
