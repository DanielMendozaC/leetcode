Fill out this comprehensive cheatsheet template for the [SPECIFIC PATTERN NAME] pattern. I'm studying for leetcode 
interviews and my goal is to crack those interviews. Please reflect on it and think step by step.


# [PATTERN NAME] Cheatsheet

## 1. Pattern Overview
**What it is:** [Brief 1-2 line description of the pattern]

**When to recognize/use this pattern:**
- [Key indicator 1: e.g., "Need to find something in sorted array"]
- [Key indicator 2: e.g., "Problem mentions 'nth from end'"]
- [Key indicator 3: e.g., "Asked to do something in O(1) space"]
- [Keyword triggers: e.g., "sliding window", "two pointers", "cycle"]

## 2. Core Template/Algorithm Steps

### General Algorithm Steps:
1. **Setup:** [Initialize variables, pointers, etc.]
2. **Main Logic:** [Core loop/recursion structure]
3. **Process:** [What happens in each iteration]
4. **Termination:** [When/how to stop]
5. **Return:** [What to return]

### Code Template:
```python
def pattern_template(input_params):
    # Step 1: Setup/Initialization
    
    # Step 2: Main logic structure
    
    # Step 3: Process/iterate
    
    # Step 4: Handle result
    
    return result
```

## 3. Common Variations
- **Variation 1:** [Name] - [When to use] - [How it differs]
- **Variation 2:** [Name] - [When to use] - [How it differs]
- **Advanced:** [Complex scenarios and modifications]

## 4. Key Insights
- **Core insight 1:** [Fundamental understanding about why this works]
- **Core insight 2:** [Mathematical or logical principle behind it]
- **Optimization insight:** [Why this is better than brute force]
- **Trade-off insight:** [What you gain vs what you sacrifice]

## 5. Complexity Analysis
**Time Complexity:**
- Best case: O(?)
- Average case: O(?)
- Worst case: O(?)

**Space Complexity:**
- O(?) - [Explain what takes up the space]

**When is this optimal:** [Conditions where this is the best approach]

## 6. Edge Cases Checklist
□ **Empty input:** [How to handle]
□ **Single element:** [Special considerations]
□ **Two elements:** [Minimum viable case]
□ **All same elements:** [Uniformity edge case]
□ **Boundary conditions:** [Min/max values, indices]
□ **Pattern-specific edges:** [Unique to this pattern]
□ **Invalid input:** [Out of bounds, null pointers, etc.]

## 7. Problem Examples
**Easy Level:**
- [Problem name] - [Key insight for this problem]
- [Problem name] - [Key insight for this problem]

**Medium Level:**
- [Problem name] - [What makes it medium difficulty]
- [Problem name] - [What makes it medium difficulty]
- [Problem name] - [What makes it medium difficulty]

**Hard Level:**
- [Problem name] - [What makes it hard]
- [Problem name] - [What makes it hard]

## 8. Common Pitfalls & Mistakes
**Coding Mistakes:**
- [Common bug 1]: [How to avoid]
- [Common bug 2]: [How to avoid]
- [Off-by-one errors]: [Where they typically occur]

**Logic Mistakes:**

## 9. Interview Tips
**Recognition:**
- [How to quickly identify this pattern in interview]
- [Questions to ask interviewer to clarify]

**Implementation:**
- [Start with this approach/setup]
- [Mention these optimizations]
- [Code in this order for clarity]

**Communication:**
- [Key points to explain to interviewer]
